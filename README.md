# Twison-ST


Twison-ST is a story format for [Twine 2](http://twinery.org/2) that simply exports to JSON with meta data.

It is inspired by [Entweedle](http://www.maximumverbosity.net/twine/Entweedle/) and [Twison](https://github.com/lazerwalker/twison) as a model for how Twine 2 story formats work.
